For a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform like **P₃ Lending**, handling **KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements** during onboarding is a crucial balance between regulatory compliance and user privacy.

### Approaches to KYC Onboarding

#### 1. **Tiered KYC Structure**
- **Low-Value Transactions:**  
  Allow new users to access microloans and basic features with minimal or no KYC, reducing friction and encouraging participation.
- **Higher Tiers for Larger Transactions:**  
  As users seek higher-value loans or increased platform privileges, progressively require more robust KYC verification (e.g., government-issued ID, proof of address).

#### 2. **Decentralized Identity Solutions**
- Integrate with decentralized identity protocols (such as **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**) to let users control their own credentials and share only what’s necessary.
- On-chain attestations can confirm KYC status without exposing sensitive data to the public.

#### 3. **Third-Party KYC Providers**
- Partner with reputable KYC service providers to handle verification securely and efficiently.
- Use APIs to confirm a user’s KYC status without storing personal data on your platform.

#### 4. **Privacy-Preserving KYC**
- Implement zero-knowledge proofs or similar cryptographic methods to verify user identity and eligibility without revealing underlying personal information.

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Clear Onboarding Steps:**  
  Guide users through what information is required at each stage, why it’s needed, and how it’s protected.
- **Status Dashboard:**  
  Let users see their current verification level and what’s required to unlock additional features.
- **Assurances of Privacy:**  
  Clearly communicate how KYC data is handled, emphasizing security and minimal data retention.

### Regulatory Compliance

- Ensure your KYC process aligns with relevant laws in your operating jurisdictions (AML, CFT, etc.).
- Regularly review and update your KYC policies as regulations evolve.
