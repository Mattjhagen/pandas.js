# Replace with the actual URL of your Google Doc
example_doc_url = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2s0_E_s_example_doc_url/edit" # Replace with a valid Google Doc URL if testing

# To test with the simplified example provided in the problem description,
# you would need a Google Doc that actually contains the data for the 'F'.
# For demonstration purposes, let's assume a hypothetical valid URL for 'F':
# (You'd need to create this doc yourself with the correct data)
# Example data for 'F':
# █,0,0
# ▀,1,0
# ▀,2,0
# ▀,3,0
# █,0,1
# ▀,1,1
# ▀,2,1
#  ,3,1
# █,0,2
#  ,1,2
#  ,2,2
#  ,3,2

# Test with a placeholder URL. You must replace this with a real public Google Doc URL.
# If you use the provided example URL in the problem, it's just a general doc, not one
# formatted with the character data, so it will likely throw an error or produce
# unexpected output unless you've specifically populated it as described.
